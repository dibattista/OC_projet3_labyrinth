# OC_projet3_labyrinth

This project is the simple game and the first project I achieve in python.

## Getting Started


Clone the repo:
``` https://github.com/dibattista/OC_projet3_labyrinth.git ```

Get the requirement file:
``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

- open the project in terminal 
- tape this command pour la version terminal: python3 main.py
et 
- python3 main.py -g pour la version graphic

To Move: 

- In terminal: r: to turn right, l to turn left, u to move up, d to move down
- In graphic mode: simply use the arrow of the keyboard.

If you want to quit the game: click on the red cross in the left corner.

Rules:
To win you need to catch all three objects in the labyrinth, simple passing on with the character, and go to the exit where the guardian are waiting for you.

If you have all the three objects you will win if not you will be dead.

To play again you need to close the game and start again.

The objects will move every time you close the game.
